Titanium 3.4 Bug - Repeatable

Click the refresh button and it will load 24 new records from the server.

The left nav shows the number of records that should be shown from in the current filter.

Attached are three screen captures.

Screen 1 is on a restart after some records have been loaded.

Second screen shows after a refresh what has happened. Notice the scroll bar on the side which shows there should be more records being shown. Third screen shows the same problem the other way.
